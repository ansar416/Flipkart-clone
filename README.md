This is a basic e-commerce web app built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Users can browse a list of products on the Product page.

Product data is dynamically loaded from a JavaScript file (data.js).

The app includes user authentication through sign-up and sign-in forms.

A responsive navigation bar is included on all major pages.

An image carousel enhances the homepage visually (carousel.html).

Each page is modular and styled with its own CSS file for clarity.

No backend or database is used; all logic and data handling is client-side.

Itâ€™s great for learning front-end development and DOM manipulation.

The app can be run by simply opening index.html in a web browser.
